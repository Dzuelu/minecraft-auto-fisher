# Minecraft Auto Fisher

Script used for a fish farm that includes treasure loot.
Includes detection indicator and shows the user where detection can occur.

To start, lineup cursor so the bobber will be just below the sign and start the script with `F8`.
To stop the script, press `F7`.

![Example of script detection with farm](/ScriptDetectionExample.png)

This script only detects when the bobber is no longer visible and recasts the line.
